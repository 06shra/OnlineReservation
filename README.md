The provided Java code represents a simple console-based online seat reservation system. Here's a description of the project:

Project Overview:
The project is an implementation of an online seat reservation system that allows users to view the seat map, reserve seats, cancel reservations, and exit the program. The system maintains the status of each seat using a boolean array.

Classes and Methods:
OnlineReservation Class:

The main class of the program.
Contains a main method that serves as the entry point of the application.
Utilizes an infinite loop to continuously prompt the user for actions until the program is manually terminated.
viewSeatMap Method:

Displays the current seat map, indicating reserved seats with "X" and empty seats with seat numbers.
Iterates through the boolean array representing seat availability.
reserveSeat Method:

Allows users to reserve a seat by inputting the desired seat number.
Checks for the validity of the seat number and whether the seat is already reserved.
Updates the status of the selected seat if it's available.
cancelReservation Method:

Enables users to cancel a reservation by providing the seat number.
Validates the seat number and checks if the seat is currently reserved.
Cancels the reservation if the seat is reserved.
Seat Representation:
The seat availability is represented by a boolean array named seats, where each index corresponds to a seat number.
If seats[i] is true, it indicates that the seat (i+1) is reserved; otherwise, it is available.
User Interaction:
The program interacts with the user through a menu-based system, allowing them to choose options by entering corresponding numbers.
Options include viewing the seat map, reserving a seat, canceling a reservation, and exiting the program.
Input Handling:
User input is collected using the Scanner class, ensuring the program can receive input from the console.
Flow Control:
The program uses a switch statement to determine the action to be taken based on the user's input.
Invalid options prompt a message to inform the user.
Termination:
The program can be terminated gracefully by choosing the "Exit" option (option 4).
Note:
The system assumes a total of 10 seats, and seat numbers range from 1 to 10.
The code does not include error handling for scenarios such as non-integer input; additional validation could be implemented for robustness.
